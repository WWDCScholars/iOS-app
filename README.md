# WWDCScholars iOS App
WWDCScholars is a community of [Apple WWDC Scholarship](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships/) winners. Every year bright minds from all around the world compete against each other for a free ticket to Apple's yearly developers conference. The scholarship recipients share their winning projects in [our iOS App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scholars-of-wwdc/id999731893?mt=8) and on [our website (WWDCScholars.com)](https://wwdcscholars.com).

We are currently building the next version of the app. Our previous app for Batch 2015 is located in this repository - https://github.com/WWDCScholars/WWDC-Scholars-iOS-2015
